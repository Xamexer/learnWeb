# learn Web
In this repository, I will document my journey to becoming a full-stack developer, showcasing various small projects across different areas of web development. This journey includes deep dives into:

* Frontend Development**: Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
* Frameworks and Libraries**: Exploring React and Redux to manage complex state and create modern, scalable web applications.
* Backend Development**: Focusing on Python with Flask and Django to develop robust and efficient server-side applications.
* **Full-Stack Integration**: Combining frontend and backend technologies to create complete, end-to-end solutions.

Along the way, I will tackle projects that cover a wide range of topics, providing practical examples and insights into the full-stack development process. This repository will serve as a comprehensive guide to my learning journey and the skills I acquire.
